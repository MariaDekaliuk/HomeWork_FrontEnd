    <pre  class="maket">
        I believe in love, it's all we got
        Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
        War makes money, cancer sleeps
        Curled up in my father and that means something to me
        Churches and dictators, politics and papers
        Everything crumbles sooner or later
        But love, I believe in love
    </pre>

    <pre  class="maket">
        I believe in love, it's all we got
        Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
        Love is simple, hate breeds
        Those who think difference is the child of disease
        Father and son make love and guns
        Families together kill someone
        Without love, I believe in love
    </pre>

    <pre  class="maket">
        Without love I wouldn't believe
        In anything that lives and breathes
        Without love I'd have no anger
        I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
        Without love I wouldn't believe
        I couldn't believe in you
        And I wouldn't believe in me
        Without love :-))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
